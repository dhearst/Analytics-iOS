# AnalyticLayer
**Easily create a layer between your app and the analytic tools that you use.**



*Analytics is essential for the continued improvement of apps. There are many tools to help you gather information, but they are constantly evolving. To handle that constant development, we have created this analytic framework to prevent horizontal change across your app. If you are looking for a simple, modular, testable, and mockable layer for your analytic tools that minimizes impact on the rest of your app, you've come to right place.*


## Features

✅  Event trackers wrapping any number of analytic tools.

✅  Analytic events that are responsible for knowing the target tool(s) to track to.

✅  Analytic parameter types that are client defined to conform to any analytic tool.

✅  Testable and mockable analytic core.

At the time of this video the framework was not released and has gone through some change since but much of the structure and usage still remains the same to date. Please feel free to check the video out.
