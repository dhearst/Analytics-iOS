Analytics is essential for the continued improvement of apps. There are many tools to help you gather information, but they are constantly evolving. 
To handle that constant development, we have created this analytic framework to prevent horizontal change across your app. 
If you are looking for a simple, modular, testable, and mockable layer for your analytic tools that minimises impact on the rest of your app, you've come to right place.
